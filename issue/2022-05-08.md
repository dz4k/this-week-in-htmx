### Andrew Meier, <cite>Dynamic forms with hyperscript</cite>

> By ‘dynamic form’ I mean an HTML form where the inputs can change based on 
> how the user populates the form. I tend to need this when there is an array
> type in the data and the number of elements in the array is specified by the
> user, or when there is a union type in the data and I want to change the
> inputs shown based on the case selected by the user. An example is worth a
> thousand more words.

JetBrains' support for htmx is still quite surreal. The tutorial is freely 
available to all:

> ASP.NET Core developers predominantly spend their development time on the
> server, trying their best to steer clear of the scary world of client-side
> development. But here's a secret, it doesn't have to be a daunting prospect

> how to take your client-side development to the next level with relative
> ease. You'll never look at client-side development the same way ever again.

## Haskell + htmx + _hyperscript?

{{#> chatlog time='20220426T0140+03' url='725789699527933952/909436816388669530/968280258015010826'}}
Rashad: My talk "Hypermedia-Driven Web Apps in Haskell" has been accepted by 
  the Houston Functional Programmers User Group. I'll be giving the talk in 
  September. This talk will be great for not only Haskell users, but any web 
  developer who would like to integrate htmx + more data-driven development or
  functional programming ideas into their web application code.\
  \
  The star of my presentation is "Function Based Views" (Django jargon [...])
  and why it works very nicely with htmx. A web app designed in this manner is
  basically a composition of simple functions with the type : 
  `toHypermedia : SomeDataType -> Hypermedia`\

> In this talk I present a new approach to building web apps in Haskell, using

> Sent Events directly in HTML, using attributes, so you can build modern user
> interfaces with the simplicity and power of hypertext. With the power of this

> meant to be a lightweight, simple tool used for rapid prototyping and
> learning server-side web development.

The talk will be held online on <time>2022-09-21T19:00-0500</time>.

Best of luck to Rashad on the talk! 💙💙💙

## _hyperscript for Sublime Text coming soon

[gnat] has been contributing to the _hyperscript grammar that powers the 
[VSCode plugin], and has undertook a [Sublime Text plugin] based on the 
same grammar.

The plugin is now awaiting approval -- a rather involved process.

Thanks to gnat for these contributions! 💙

--- Some doubletexts have been merged ---
1cg: i think we should go back to one file man
1cg: one big ol javascript file. maximum contrarian. lets do it. c'mon
Deniz Akşimşek: but scrolling is so tiring
1cg: tab switching is worse! one, single, glorious, insane file, it speaks to me
--- ... ---
Deniz Akşimşek: ok. compromise: we will make each plugin be one module
--- ... ---
Deniz Akşimşek: what is our goal for browser support btw? 
1cg: hyperscript or htmx? 
Deniz Akşimşek: hyperscript
1cg: modern browsers -- all browsers - IE
Deniz Akşimşek: how modern, can we depend on import
1cg: we can talk beyond that
1cg: caniuse: [Image: [Can I use modules?](https://caniuse.com/?search=modules)] not awful
1cg: y tho when we can have one big file 🤌
Deniz Akşimşek:
  ~~~ html
  <script type="module">
  import _hyperscript from "https://esm.sh/hyperscript.org"
  import eventsource "https://esm.sh/hyperscript.org/eventsource"
  _hyperscript.use(eventsource)
  </script>
  ~~~
1cg: I guess I can live with that
Deniz Akşimşek: if we can depend on ES modules i can finally fix workers
1cg: 😑 I'm willing to take a look at it.
1cg: how did I get from "one file" to "es modules" in ~5min? 😑
Deniz Akşimşek: es modules are the simplest
1cg: ... next to...
Deniz Akşimşek: making sure the right global variable is there sucks. ordering
  script tags correctly sucks. `(function() { ... })()` what the fuck is this
1cg: 100% agreement there
{{/ chatlog }}

Seems pretty positive so far, right? But there are some caveats...

{{#> chatlog time="20220427T1636+03" url='725789699527933952/796428329531605032/968687030974418994' }}
gnat: es modules bring their own layer of complexity and barrier to entry tbh.\
  \
  one file + no build step = anyone can jump in and get context without setting
  up a build system. less moving parts.\
  \
  The cost of removing simplicity is always difficult to forsee the 
  consequences of because were all so ready to use the new shiny...
gnat: Carson has been around long enough to see so much tech come and go.. he's
  super well in-tune for keeping it anti-hype, anti-layer.\
  \
  Its this exact reason so many of us love htmx and hyperscript. \
  \
  Its why they will stand the test of time.
Deniz Akşimşek: Explain how es modules add complexity over something like UMD
gnat: sadly es modules require a server environment because of CORS.\
  \
  `(function() { ... })()` just works man, even from plain .html files 
  directly off your drive.\
  \
  that's a big advantage: A new dev from the orange site can download 
  hyperwordle.html and actually tinker with it.\
  \
  playing with real hyperscript is IMHO the quickest way to make a new 
  user-- Getting to that point needs to be friction free: the language is 
  already different enough!\
  \
  It'll be detrimental to the growth of the language for new users to get hung
  up on CORS shit.
gnat: That said, didn't mean to come off as harsh, you're an amazing 
  contributor dude.
Deniz Akşimşek: i guess the real problem is that the hyperscript codebase is
  aging and i'm just trying to compensate
{{/ chatlog}}

I hadn't even thought of this, since I never try to view local HTML files
without a server. That's why participating in the development of things you use
is important! 🐝

The _hyperscript codebase has grown quite quickly, and to simplify it, we need 
your feedback:

 - Would you be fine with needing a dev server to run a file? (i.e.: 
   `python3 -m http.server`)
 - Do you need to support browsers that lack ES Modules?


## How to test HTML templates

{{#> chatlog time='20220417T1940+03' url='725789699527933952/929014829212123156/965290782137389076'}}
h*ckraiser666: fairly new to both go and htmx; do you guys unit test your html
  template files? coming from stuff like react, unit testing your components is
  par for the course. wondering if there are some strategies for server side
  templates too
TardisX: I do 🙂 With the proper abstractions it's quite easy. I am doing simple
  regex based checks of content output, but you could use something like goquery
  if you needed to do DOM traversal style stuff as well.
3Dayo: I tend to use goquery far more in my tests than regex
h*ckraiser666: oh interesting. I’ll check that out
benpate: Ashamed to say "no" I don't really unit test my templates.  At some 
  point, front-end testing gets hard because presentation is so subjective.  
  But, I'm thinking I probably could (ok, should) make some tests where I pass
  in different values and guarantee that the templates don't error out.
benpate: Goquery is awesome and underused 🙂
Deniz Akşimşek: microformats are the answer to everything.
Deniz Akşimşek: put your html through a microformats parser then test the 
  output data
Deniz Akşimşek: i don't think you can test a template in isolation, you need to
  test the endpoint that renders it
benpate: Ok, who does this college kid think he is, and why are his answers 
  always correct?
benpate: I have been working microformats into my latest templates. They are 
  spiritually similar to htmx -- walking the full circle from computer-readable
  HTML -> human-readable HTML -> then back again to computer-readable.
Deniz Akşimşek: there's something very philosophically pleasing about humans 
  and API clients using the same source of truth
{{/ chatlog}}

This story is very important and definitely not a front for me to promote 
[microformats].

## Use the _204 No Content_ status code to optimize polling

A user had a table being polled every 2 seconds. The table was being augmented
with a JavaScript library, which caused jitter every time the server was polled
--- regardless of whether the table changed.

{{#> chatlog time='20220426T2213+03' url='725789699527933952/725789747212976259/968590589463506994'}}
Deniz Akşimşek: compute some sort of hash for the data in the table and put it
  in an `<input type="hidden">`, include that hash in the request with 
  hx-include, on the server if the data hasn't changed return 204 No Content
{{/ chatlog}}

You can use the _204 No Content_ status code to tell browsers they should keep
showing the old page, and htmx respects this convention by not swapping.

There is actually a bit of a debate about whether htmx should swap 204
responses. I hold that if you need anything visible to happen upon the response
being received, 204 is the wrong status code to use --- use _200 OK_ with an
empty body instead.
